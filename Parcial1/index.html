                <h1>Stardew Valley</h1>
                <p>Stardew Valley is a farming simulation video game developed by ConcernedApe. In the game, players
                    take on
                    the role of a character who inherits a run-down farm and must work to restore it to its former
                    glory.
                    Players can grow crops, raise animals, mine for resources, fish, and engage in various activities to
                    build relationships with the townspeople.</p>

                        <h3>Crops</h3>
                        <p>Crops are plants that players can grow on their farm. They require watering and care to grow,
                            and
                            once harvested, they can be sold for profit or used in various recipes.</p>

                        <h3>Animals</h3>
                        <p>Players can raise animals such as cows, chickens, and sheep on their farm. Animals require
                            feeding
                            and care, and they produce resources like milk, eggs, and wool that can be sold or used in
                            crafting.</p>

                            the
                            town and catch different types of fish depending on the season and weather conditions.</p>
